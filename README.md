# Github Blog

Welcome to the Github Blog, a web application developed as a challenge for Rocketseat's Ignite course. Our goal is to create a simple and intuitive environment for developers to share their ideas and projects with the community.

With Github Blog, it is possible to create, edit and publish posts through Github itself, as an "issue" in a given repository (configurable through the .env file). In addition, our application uses the Github API to fetch information about the user and display it in their blog profile.
